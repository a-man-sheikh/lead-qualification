# Product Offer API

A Node.js API for lead scoring and qualification using rule-based scoring and AI-powered intent classification.

> **‚è±Ô∏è Performance Note:** The scoring API (`POST /api/score`) may take some time to complete as it calls the Google Gemini AI API for each lead to determine intent classification. Processing time depends on the number of leads being scored.

## Rule Logic & AI Prompts

### Scoring System Overview

- Industry directly matches ideal use cases
- Keywords: SaaS, Software, Tech, Technology, FinTech, HealthTech, E-commerce, Retail, Manufacturing, Healthcare, Finance, Banking, Insurance, Real Estate, Education, Media, Entertainment, Gaming, Automotive, Aerospace, Energy, Telecommunications, Consulting, Legal, Marketing, Advertising

**Adjacent Industries (+10 points):**
- Related industries that might benefit from the product
- Example: SaaS ‚Üî Software ‚Üî Technology

#### 3. Data Completeness Scoring (Max 10 points)

- **80-99% complete:** +7 points  
- **60-79% complete:** +5 points
- **<60% complete:** 0 points

### AI-Powered Intent Classification

#### AI Prompt Template
The AI service uses Google Gemini to analyze lead intent with this prompt structure:

```
You are an expert sales qualification AI. Analyze the following lead and product offer to determine buying intent.

PRODUCT/OFFER DETAILS:
- Name: [offer.name]
- Value Propositions: [offer.value_props.join(", ")]
- Ideal Use Cases: [offer.ideal_use_cases.join(", ")]

LEAD INFORMATION:
- Name: [lead.name]
- Role: [lead.role]
- Company: [lead.company]
- Industry: [lead.industry]
- Location: [lead.location]
- LinkedIn Bio: [lead.linkedin_bio]

ANALYSIS CRITERIA:
1. Role Authority: Does this person have decision-making power or influence?
2. Industry Fit: Does their industry align with the product's ideal use cases?
3. Company Size: Is this likely a target company size?
4. Profile Completeness: Does their profile suggest they're actively seeking solutions?
5. Pain Point Alignment: Does their role/industry likely face problems this product solves?

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Classify the buying intent as High, Medium, or Low and provide a brief 1-2 sentence explanation.

Your response should be in this exact format:
INTENT: [High/Medium/Low]
REASONING: [1-2 sentence explanation]
```

#### AI Scoring Mapping
- **High Intent:** 50 points
- **Medium Intent:** 30 points  
- **Low Intent:** 10 points

### Total Score Calculation
```
Total Score = Rule Score (0-50) + AI Score (0-50)
Final Classification:
- 80-100: High Priority Lead
- 50-79: Medium Priority Lead  
- 0-49: Low Priority Lead
```

### Business Rules
1. **Single Offer Rule:** Only one offer can exist at a time. Creating a new offer requires updating the existing one.
2. **Lead Replacement:** Uploading new leads replaces all existing leads in the database.
3. **Scoring Persistence:** Once scored, leads retain their scores unless re-scored.
4. **Error Handling:** Failed AI classifications default to "Low" intent with 10 points.
